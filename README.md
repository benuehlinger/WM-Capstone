# CMS Star Rating Project
The CMS Star Rating is a quality metric that clusters hospitals into peer groups based on various measures, and scores them on a scale of 1-to-5. Using publicly available data, our three-person team [replicated](https://github.com/benuehlinger/WM-Capstone/blob/main/OMSBA%20Deliverable/Replication%20and%20Analyses/SAS%20Star%20Data/Source%20Code/Python%20Replicate.ipynb) the rating algorithm for 4,000+ hospitals, [used machine learning to identify key measures](), and [simulated future star rating changes]() to deliver insights to our client, Riverside Hospital.
